### Your Daily Budget React App.
This app is like a simple budget tracker for daily expenses. You input items and their prices into a form, and it keeps track of your total spending for the day. If your total spending exceeds $50, it gives you a warning. Each item you add appears in a list, along with its price, and at the bottom, it shows the total amount spent for the day. It's a handy tool for managing your daily expenses and staying within your budget.
